  desc: "As part of my work as a fellow at the Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCDOI), I analyzed 
  participants data in COVID-19 data science competitions on the Ironhacks platform to gather interesting observations, 
  and determine the important factors that best predicts whether a participant will submit or not. The results were presented at 
  ACM Collective Intelligence Conference 2021"

- name: IronHacks COVID-19 Data Science Challenge
  i18n: jalpc
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/ironhacks_coivd19.jpg
  desc: "Participated and won third place in the Ironhacks COVID-19 Data Science Challenge,
  where the task was to predict the weekly foot traffic at merchants in Indiana in order to understand the COVID-19 impact and risk. 
  To solve this problem I used Python to train a ridge regression model that was able to obtain 
  good results in predicting the foot traffic at various stores in Indiana."
  
- name: Flower Species Identification
  i18n: jalpc

  gh_user: mai0elkady
  repo: flower_classifier
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/flowers_small.jpg
  desc: "Employed a DenseNet pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network model to train an image classifier to identify 102 different species of flowers. 
  The code was written in Python and used PyTorch for deep learning, and the training was done utilizing GPUs on Google Colab. 
  The project was then deployed as a webapp using Flask on herokuapp"
  
- name: Synthetic Genotype Data Simulator

  desc: "As part of a team, implemented a data simulator in C/C++ that generates synthetic genotype data using
the Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly (PSD) model."

- name: Predicting Pulp Fiction Lovers
  i18n: google

  desc: "As part of a class Kaggle competition, tried several Machine learning approaches, and coded them in R
and Python, to predict whether users will like the movie Pulp Fiction given their previous movie ratings."
