  desc: I am a second year computer science PhD student at Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. I got my masters in Computer Science from the same university in May 2018. I am studying under the supervision
  of Prof. Petros Drineas. My area of research interest are: Machine learning, Deep learning, Computational Biology and Bioinfomatics. 
  I am originally from Cairo, Egypt, and I did not realize how much I miss the sun except after spending a winter in West Lafayette, IN.
